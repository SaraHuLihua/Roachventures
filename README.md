## Story
Once upon a time, there was a brave little cockroach who lived a quiet life. His typical day consisted of foraging for food and hiding from humans.
One day, however, his quiet life was disrupted. A family became aware of the cockroach's presence and decided to end its existence with a powerful disinfectant. Frightened and determined to survive, the cockroach fled underground, embarking on an epic journey to escape the disinfestation and its inevitable end.

Will our hero be saved?
